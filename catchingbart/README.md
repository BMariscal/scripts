[This script](https://github.com/BMariscal/scripts/blob/master/catchingbart/catching_bart.py) gives you the route schedule times for the route 1 bart (PITT station to MLBR)

[This other script](https://github.com/BMariscal/scripts/blob/master/catchingbart/cmd_catching_bart.py) does the same thing but you are able to change the api url from the command line, making the script more flexible. 
- Used the bart API. Acquired the API key from http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers
- Used the bart API documentation
- Used urllib to access api data
- Used ElementTree library to manipulate XML/used the ElementTree [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)
