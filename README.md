# scripts

### [autofill](https://github.com/BMariscal/scripts/blob/master/auto_fill.py):
Script uses Selenium and chromedriver. The script automatically logs you into Reddit. [Good resource to aid in script customization.](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html)


### [catching bart](https://github.com/BMariscal/python_programming_language/tree/master/lesson_1):

Scripts were modified by me to parse the <b>bart api</b> (the original lesson script parsed a chicago bus system website). The bart api used a standard XML output. <em>I used urllib to access the api data and used the ElementTree library to manipulate XML</em>.

 ##### [First script](https://github.com/BMariscal/python_programming_language/blob/master/lesson_1/catching_bart.py)
    gives you the route schedule times for the route 1 bart (PITT station to MLBR).

 ##### [Second script](https://github.com/BMariscal/python_programming_language/blob/master/lesson_1/cmd_catching_bart.py)
     does the same as the script above but you are able to change the api url from the command line,
     making the script customizable and more flexible.
